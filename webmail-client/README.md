# ForwardEmail Webmail Client

Pure client-side PWA for ForwardEmail webmail. Built with Vite and Knockout.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd webmail-client
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

You can override the API base in a local `.env`:

```
WEBMAIL_API_BASE=https://api.forwardemail.net
WEBMAIL_MOCK=1    # keep mock data instead of calling API (optional)
```

## Assets Needed

- Fonts in `public/fonts` (`NunitoSans-Regular/Bold` and `VCHoney-Regular` as `.woff2`/`.woff`)
- PWA icons exist as gradient placeholders in `public/icons` (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`); replace with final maskable-safe assets when ready

## Notes

- `index.html` renders the login card and registers the service worker; `/mailbox` shows a skeleton (folders/list/reader) with sample data until the full UI is built.
- `src/main.js` boots Knockout bindings and the animated starfield.
- API calls are routed through `src/utils/remote.js` to `https://api.forwardemail.net`.
- Service worker is generated by VitePWA (`/sw.js`) using the config in `vite.config.js`; we supply our own `public/manifest.json`.
- Basic auth is always stored (`webmail_alias_auth`) after login for mailbox decryption; requests use this header even if a token is returned.
- Message bodies are sanitized with DOMPurify before rendering in the reader pane.
