Add `NunitoSans` (regular and bold) and `VC Honey` font files here as `.woff2` and `.woff`.
The CSS in `src/styles/main.css` expects:

- `NunitoSans-Regular.woff2` / `.woff`
- `NunitoSans-Bold.woff2` / `.woff`
- `VCHoney-Regular.woff2` / `.woff`

Store them alongside this README so they are served from `/fonts/`.
