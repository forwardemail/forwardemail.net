  "Professional Branding": "专业品牌",
  ": Use email addresses with your custom domain (": "：使用带有自定义域名的电子邮件地址（",
  ") while managing everything from your existing personal inbox": "）同时管理您现有的个人收件箱中的所有内容",
  "Privacy Protection": "隐私保护",
  ": Create disposable or purpose-specific addresses that shield your primary email": "：创建一次性或专用地址来保护您的主要电子邮件",
  "Simplified Management": "简化管理",
  ": Consolidate multiple email addresses into a single inbox": "：将多个电子邮件地址合并到一个收件箱中",
  ": Create unlimited addresses for different purposes without managing multiple accounts": "：为不同目的创建无限地址，无需管理多个账户",
  "For those interested in the technical details, let's explore what happens behind the scenes when an email is forwarded.": "对于那些对技术细节感兴趣的人，让我们来探索一下转发电子邮件时幕后发生的情况。",
  "DNS Configuration": "DNS 配置",
  ": The process begins with your domain's DNS records. When you set up email forwarding, you configure MX (Mail Exchange) records that tell the internet where emails for your domain should be delivered. These records point to our email servers.": "：该过程从您域名的 DNS 记录开始。设置电子邮件转发时，您需要配置 MX（邮件交换）记录，以告知互联网应将您域名的电子邮件发送到何处。这些记录指向我们的电子邮件服务器。",
  "Email Reception": "电子邮件接收",
  ": When someone sends an email to your custom domain address (e.g.,": "：当有人向您的自定义域名地址发送电子邮件时（例如，",

  "Scan for malicious content": "扫描恶意内容",
  "Check the recipient against your forwarding rules": "根据您的转发规则检查收件人",
  "Sender Rewriting": "发件人重写",
  ": This is where the magic happens. We implement Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) to modify the return path of the email. This is crucial because many email providers reject forwarded emails without proper SRS implementation, as they can appear to be spoofed.": "：这就是奇迹发生的地方。我们实施发件人重写方案 (SRS) 来修改电子邮件的返回路径。这一点至关重要，因为许多电子邮件提供商会拒绝未正确实施 SRS 的转发电子邮件，因为它们可能看起来像是伪造的。",

  "Delivery": "送货",
  ": The email arrives in your inbox, appearing as if it was sent to your forwarding address, maintaining the professional appearance of your custom domain.": "：电子邮件到达您的收件箱，看起来就像是发送到您的转发地址一样，保持了您的自定义域的专业外观。",
  "SRS deserves special attention because it's essential for reliable email forwarding. When an email is forwarded, the sender's address needs to be rewritten to ensure the email passes SPF checks at the final destination.": "SRS 值得特别关注，因为它对于可靠的电子邮件转发至关重要。转发电子邮件时，需要重写发件人的地址，以确保电子邮件在最终目的地通过 SPF 检查。",
  "Without SRS, forwarded emails often fail SPF verification and get marked as spam or rejected entirely. Our implementation of SRS ensures your forwarded emails are delivered reliably while maintaining the original sender information in a way that's transparent to you.": "如果没有 SRS，转发的电子邮件通常会无法通过 SPF 验证，并被标记为垃圾邮件或被完全拒绝。我们对 SRS 的实施可确保您转发的电子邮件可靠地送达，同时以对您透明的方式保留原始发件人信息。",

Email forwarding works similarly, but for digital messages.": "可以将电子邮件转发视为实体邮件的邮件转发。当您搬到新家时，您可以要求邮政服务将您旧地址的所有邮件转发到新地址。电子邮件转发的工作原理类似，但针对的是数字消息。",
  "With Forward Email:": "转发电子邮件：",
