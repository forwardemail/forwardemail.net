  "There are also solutions that use \"serverless\" technologies, such as through Amazon SES and Amazon Lambda, but again they are extremely confusing, time intensive, and no typical user would go to those lengths for setup (and instead would probably end up using a simpler alternative as we almost did; in exchange for lack of privacy).": "也有使用“无服务器”技术的解决方案，例如通过Amazon SES和Amazon Lambda，但是它们又非常混乱，费时，并且没有典型的用户愿意花那么多的时间进行设置（而最终可能会使用我们几乎所做的更简单的选择；以换取缺乏隐私）。",
