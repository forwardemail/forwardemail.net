Subject: Test Email for Deliverability Analysis
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello,

This is a test email to demonstrate the email deliverability analysis tool.

Key features being tested:
- SPF authentication (should pass)
- DKIM signature validation (should pass)
- DMARC policy compliance (should pass)
- IP reputation analysis
- Header validation

The sending server has proper authentication configured:
- SPF record exists and includes the sending IP
- DKIM signature is valid with 2048-bit key
- DMARC policy is set to quarantine

This email should demonstrate a well-configured email setup with good deliverability prospects.

Best regards,
John Doe
