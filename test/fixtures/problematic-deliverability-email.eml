Subject: Test Email with Authentication Issues

Hello,

This is a test email that demonstrates common deliverability problems:

Authentication Issues Demonstrated:
- SPF FAIL: The sending IP is not authorized in the SPF record
- DKIM NONE: No DKIM signature present on the email
- DMARC FAIL: Domain alignment fails due to SPF and DKIM failures

DNS Configuration Problems:
- Missing or incorrect SPF record
- No DKIM selector configured  
- Restrictive DMARC policy with no valid authentication

Server Issues:
- Sending from non-authorized IP address
- No domain authentication setup
- Poor sender reputation likely

This email would likely be:
- Rejected by strict email providers
- Sent to spam folder by most providers
- Flagged as potentially fraudulent
- Subject to delivery delays

Recommendations would include:
1. Fix SPF record to include sending IP
2. Set up DKIM signing with proper keys
3. Adjust DMARC policy to quarantine until auth is fixed
4. Use authenticated SMTP relay
5. Monitor sender reputation

Best regards,
Bad Config Example
