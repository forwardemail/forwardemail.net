## Service Level Agreement ("SLA")

### Terms

* "Downtime" refers to a factor of more than a 5% user error rate, determined by a server-side error rate.
* "Monthly Uptime Percentage" refers to the total minutes in a calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered in the calendar month, divided by the total minutes in the calendar month.

### Agreement

Forward Email shall use all reasonable commercial efforts (no less than acceptable and reasonable industry standards) to ensure that the Forward Email service is available to paying customers 99.99% of the time in any calendar month.  If it is not, then you may be eligible to receive the [Credits](#credits) described below in accordance with [Eligibility](#eligibility).

### Credits

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Days of Service* |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| < 99.99% – >= 99.90%      | 3                |
| < 99.90% – >= 95.00%      | 7                |
| < 95.50%                  | 15               |

\* Instead of receiving Days of Service being added to your account, you can also choose to have us issue a pro-rated refund.

### Eligibility

Minimum credit amount must be at least $1.00 to be eligible.  Maximum credit is capped at the 30 days or the total amount the customer is paying per the most recent calendar month with respect to Downtime (whichever is greater).  Paying customers affected for any Downtime must request Credits by filing a [Help request](/help) within 30 days from the date of Downtime.  Credits only apply for Downtime factors that are within the primary control of Forward Email.
