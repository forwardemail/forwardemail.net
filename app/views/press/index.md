## About Forward Email

Forward Email is the only 100% open-source email hosting service focused on security and privacy.

Our service was founded in 2017 and powers email for over 500,000 domains – including notable users such as Netflix, The Linux Foundation, several universities and governments, and more.

Our goal is to be the enterprise-grade email and security infrastructure platform – and we adhere to [several principles](https://forwardemail.net/blog/docs/best-quantum-safe-encrypted-email-service#principles).

If you are a member of the press, a journalist, or a media representative and would like to speak with us, ask questions, or learn more – then please contact us at `press@forwardemail.net`.
