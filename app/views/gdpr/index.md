## Foreword

Forward Email is a privacy-focused company committed to protecting your data.

The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) ("GDPR") governs the transfer of data outside of the EU and EEA, and its goals are to enhance your control and rights over your personal information.  Fortunately we do not sell any data we process, store, and/or transfer – nor do we use such data for any other purpose than to provide our services to you.

At **anytime** you can modify your personal information under [My Account → Profile](/my-account/profile) and even delete your entire account and all related information under [My Account → Security](/my-account/security).  Since **we are 100% open-source** at <https://github.com/forwardemail> – our source code can also be audited for compliance with privacy laws at anytime.

Our [Data Processing Agreement](/dpa) details our compliance with the GDPR as well as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks, with respect to privacy of data processed, stored, and transferred.

By agreeing to our [Terms of Service](/terms), you are automatically accepting our DPA and do not need to sign a separate document.  We will make our best effort to protect all of your personal data in according with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) – **no matter the location** in which it is processed, stored, and transferred.  You can also learn more by reading our [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy).


## International Data Transfer

Since we process, store, and transfer data internationally (e.g. an email sent from one country to another) – it is important that we respect applicable local privacy laws.

Listed below are our providers which we use to transfer data internationally and links to their dedicated pages regarding their GDPR compliance.
